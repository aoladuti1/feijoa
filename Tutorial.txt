Hi there! This text will show you how to regenerate the parser for 
newer versions of the Feijoa language (as specified by Parsing/Feijoa.art)
and run Feijoa (.fj) files.

--- Regenerate .fj parser ---

./feijoa -p [file]
	update the parser or Feijoa
	if file is specified, run it

--- Run .fj files ---

./feijoa -r <qualified name>
	run name.fj

Note: adding the directory of feijoa.bat to your PATH removes the need of './' in commands

Example command: ./feijoa -r Projects/Demos/assignDemo
Note: the .fj extension is optional
