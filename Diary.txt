Since first committing to this project a few days ago, 
I have managed to set up scripts for generating parsers and parsing/running .fj files.
Further to this, I have implemented and provided a basis for a duck-typing system,
and added assignment (-> or <-) and addition (+) operators which are fully functional. Parentheses are supported.

Next Steps:
   1 - Add all mathematical operations
   2 - Add comparison / extra operators

Since my last diary entry I have improved my scripts, BNF structure and added exponentiation. 

Next Steps:
   1 - Continue adding operations
   2 - remove the -> operator for now. Use for function chaining later.

Since my last diary entry I have implemented a better structure for my BNF that respects operation order.
I added multiply functionality too, and ensured the not operator would work when applied repeatedly (!!false == false).
It was tricky to find a good way to make the order of operations not too verbose and fit with duck typing.

Next steps:
   1 - Finish adding all operations
   2 - Make helper functions / class for duck typing
   3 - Change strings to double quotes instead of single quotes
