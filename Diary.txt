[10/10/2022] 
Since first committing to this project a few days ago, 
I have managed to set up scripts for generating parsers and parsing/running .fj files.
Further to this, I have implemented and provided a basis for a duck-typing system,
and added assignment (-> or <-) and addition (+) operators which are fully functional. Parentheses are supported.
Assignment can work in two ways:
   1. Value -> Variable
   2. Variable <- Value

Next Steps:
   1 - Add all mathematical operations
   2 - Add comparison / extra operators

[31/10/2022]
Since my last diary entry I have improved my scripts, so parsing Feijoa and running it are split
into concrete commands. Feijoa.art has an improved BNF structure, and also has exponentiation. 

Next Steps:
   1 - Continue adding operations
   2 - remove the -> operator for now. (Use for function chaining later?)

[07/11/2022]
Since my last diary entry, I have implemented a better structure for my BNF that respects operation order.
I added multiplication functionality too, and ensured the not operator would work when applied repeatedly (!!false == false).
It was tricky to find a good way to make the order of operations well-defined and fixed with duck typing.

Next steps:
   1 - Finish adding all operations
   2 - Make helper functions / class for duck typing
   3 - Change strings to double quotes instead of single quotes

[10/11/2022]
Since my last diary entry, I added helper functions for duck typing, boolean algebra, 
tighter BNF formatting and a plus-equals operator '+<-'.
I had to avoid += due to it looking unusual in this language.
I also had a lot of trouble with the not operator priority as it was meshed with math operators.

Next steps:
   1 - Make a helper class
   2 - Finish adding operations
   3 - Start work on branching

[18/11/2022]
Since my last diary entry, I detoured from adding more operators to work on branching.
Because the order of operations is set up, adding further operators is essentially clerical.
Added greater than (>) operator.
I added working if and chainable else if statements. This was done by evaluating the prior if or else if statement
expression and exploiting the longest-match parse nature of art.

Next steps:
   1 - Make a helper class
   2 - Add an else branch
   3 - Finish a good chunk of operators

[21/11/2022]
Since my last diary entry, I properly implemented my FJ helper class to handle
operators, and added a 'while' and 'until' loop, with code neatening. 
Some extra operations were also added (minusEquals [-=], negate (-), equals [==]...)

Next steps:
   1 - Add a less than operator
   2 - Implement structs
   3 - Implement basic functions

[24/11/2022]
Since my last diary entry, I implemented structs. Doing so required extreme levels of planning and attention to detail.
The arrow <- is the struct assignment operator now, and all other assignment uses the equals sign (=).
Due to misspecification in the BNF my first solution to struct
implementation involved processing going from the last argument to the first one, in a convoluted way, 
but I remedied this to be front to back.
Later, I also implemented an argument context stack (FJArgStack.java) that uses
pushes and pops of a context ArrayList to figure out what variable the argument(s) are being passed to, 
what argument is currently being processed, and how many arguments there are in total.

FJ.java was extended to assist with struct definition and holds a hashtable with key, value
pairings of [the struct type name] (String) and [its member variables] (ArrayList<FJNamedObject>). Note that an FJNamedObj
is a pair-type class for Java classes String and Object.
FJ.java also holds a HashMap of struct typenames as keys and an ArrayList of FJNamedObj member variables as values.

Python-like argument comments called argNotes were implemented too. After specifying an argument, before the comma separator,
you can add a colon and then text equivalent to a valid variable name. e.g. z <- Donkey(10: weight_donkey). ArgNotes are purely visual
and do nothing programmatically.

Virtually all of the above is either used or shown in the demo program structs.fj.

Next steps:
    1 - Add a less than operator
    2 - Add a walrus operator and more
    3 - Document BNF more

[02/12/2022]
Since my last diary entry, I implemented a less-than operator, improved documentation
and fixed some bugs.

Next steps:
    1 - Add a walrus operator
    2 - Refactor where possible (especially variable names in the helper classes)
    3 - Try implementing numbers with BigDecimal

[05/12/2022]
Since my last diary entry, I have written a greatest common factor program in the Projects folder.

Next steps:
    1 - Same as previous
    2 - Add a sysin function
    3 - Move built-in functions to the expression section of Feijoa.art 

[23/01/2023]
Since my last diary entry, I have implemented functions and greatly improved the symbol table with class STable.
Similar to Python, it is possible to both specify default arguments and also to specifically define arguments with the
equals operator. e.g. def x(foo=null, bar) { x(foo=2); }
Recursion is possible with the new class FJCallStack. Scopes now work correctly.
The use of BigDecimal is now considered redundant.

AND --------------->

[24/01/2023] 
Since my last diary entry, I added a sysin function and a Fibonacci program written in Feijoa.

Next Steps:
    1 - Rework structs to be full-on classes
    2 - Add a sysin function
    3 - Store type information in variables to speed up duck typing

[02/02/2023]
Since my last diary entry, I added nested structs, and did a large amount of refactoring.
I will not be implementing classes in this project, most likely. 

Next steps:
    1 - Add lambdas
    2 - Add lists
    3 - Store type information in variables to speed up duck typing

[07/02/2023]
Since my last diary entry, I added nested functions, closures, Java-style lambdas, Python-style lambdas
and tightened up syntax. Adding closures was extremely difficult as I had to essentially make all function objects
hold a list of potential outer function symbol tables, and implementing this change was not easy.

Next steps:
    1 - Add lists
    2 - Store type information in variables to speed up duck typing
    3 - Finish adding operations

[12/03/2023]
Since my last diary entry, I have vastly extended and stabilised the language, 
done extensive refactoring and written helpful documentation.

See the following major amendments:
-the representation for Feijoa objects is no longer just the Java Object class, but the class FJTO
	strong typing is properly implemented as now variables hold their type information and so
	duck typing is much faster. Operator interactions are now well-defined.
-the null type is now formalised
-all built-in functions now have an exclamation mark at the end, as they aren't true functions (e.g. sysout!())
-exhaustive bugfixes
-the exponentiate operator can now return ints if both operands are ints and the output is a whole number
-major Feijoa.art BNF cleanup and proper organisation
-general refactoring
-room made in code for future user error messaging / handling
-improved and far more frequent documention in both Feijoa.art and the helper classes
-stabilised the equivalency operator
-significantly extended and improved the demo programs
-renamed built-in function sysline to sysln
-renamed and extended whileUntil.fj into loops.fj
-renamed FJLStack to FJLCStack (stack for list construction)
-renamed FJSAStack to FJSCStack (stack for struct construction)

The following helper Java classes were also added:
-FJARStack (a stack for resolving assignment to a list of a list)
-FJList (an underlying Java representation of a Feijoa list)
-FJTypes (an enum class of Feijoa primitives)

And, lastly, the following features were added (in roughly this order):
-FJTypes.java, an enum class of Feijoa primitive types 
-vastly improved type-hinting and ArgNotes, now allowing for return hints (even in lambdas)
	and also types like list[str] or [str] or even list[[str], [int]]
-sysin!() -> str | built-in function (gets a line of user input)
-updated Fibonacci program to ask for user input
-a type!(object) -> str built-in function to return the type of an object as a string
-typecasting 
-lists (+ operator concatenates lists)
-list ranges (1..4 == [1, 2, 3]) 
-append!(list, object) -> null | built-in function
-remove!(list, index) -> object | built-in function
-add!(list, index, object) -> null | built-in function
-break and continue loop keywords
-len!(list/str) -> int | built-in function
-'&&' / 'and' are equivalent keywords. '||' / 'or' are equivalent keywords.
-prefix and postfix increment and decrement operators
-modulo (%) operator added
-operator-equals operations added: i.e. += -= *= /= **= %=
-multi-assign (python list assignment e.g. x, y = ["x", "y"])
-java-style for loops
-'loop' keyword (equiv. to while(true) { ... }
-java-style and python-style ternary operators
