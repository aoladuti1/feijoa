Since first committing to this project a few days ago, 
I have managed to set up scripts for generating parsers and parsing/running .fj files.
Further to this, I have implemented and provided a basis for a duck-typing system,
and added assignment (-> or <-) and addition (+) operators which are fully functional. Parentheses are supported.

Next Steps:
   1 - Add all mathematical operations
   2 - Add comparison / extra operators
